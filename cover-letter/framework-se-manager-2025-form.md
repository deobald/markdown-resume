## Why Framework?

I've been absolutely obsessed with the Right to Repair and the Linux desktop since 2002. I own a Framework Laptop 13 and it is a joy to use. Framework's mission, product strategy, and approach to business represent a cultural shift in the way corporations produce both B2B and B2C products. It really feels as though Framework's business model is the way all companies should conduct themselves in the future. I want to be a part of the watershed moment that Framework represents.

While I was Executive Director at the GNOME Foundation, I had calls with Matt Hartley every two weeks. If Matt represents the kind of people Framework hires, I also feel that this is the perfect environment for me to work in. It sounds like Framework has lovely folks working there who aren't just dedicated to the mission, but who treat each other with a warmth and respect that is missing from many organizations.

## Rails

Yes, I have been working with Rails since it was pre-1.0 and have built some of the first commercial Ruby, JRuby, and Rails systems in the world. I've worked with some of the older Ruby/Rails personalities, such as David Chelimsky and Obie Fernandes. I've been working with Rails on and off for 20 years, and currently maintain a production, open source Rails service for a nonprofit (Pariyatti).
