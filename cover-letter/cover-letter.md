I have been programming since I was eleven years old.
When I was fourteen, I started my first profitable business building custom websites for customers across North America.
During my time at university, I worked across public, private, and co-operative sectors.
This breadth of experience gave me a foundation upon which I could choose future employers and a framework for building
my own companies and non-profit projects.

After graduating from university, I joined ThoughtWorks where I worked with some of the earliest teams delivering software
using lean and agile methods.
During my time at ThoughtWorks, I became intimately familiar with pair programming, (true) OOP, TDD, CI/CD,
build health, production metrics and monitoring, and what is now known as Trunk-Based Development.
This was also my first exposure to functional and immutable programming in production, in addition to my first opportunity
to serve teams as a Tech Lead, where I began to work at the level of architecture and project management.
I transferred these skills to my three years at DRW, where I helped spearhead a complete rewrite of the trade capture and
positions management platform, oversaw architecture and delivery of the company's replacement reference data system, and
introduced the first immutable data and functional programming tools to production as a method of improving team productivity.
All software I built for ThoughtWorks and DRW was written in C#, Java, JRuby, and Clojure.

In 2011, I moved to India and built RubyMonk, a tool for learning to program in the browser, for C42 Engineering.
When C42 closed its doors, I founded Nilenso Software, India's first employee-owned technology company and oversaw its
growth to $1m ARR.
Throughout my time at Nilenso, I hired developers, designers, operations staff, and even my replacement as CEO.
I was engaged in every sales call and negotiated our contracts.
I mentored our staff in programming, cloud ops (both AWS and smaller cloud vendors), automation, sales, recruitment,
project management, and consulting skills.
This time spent building a self-sufficient company paid off:
despite my exit in 2018, Nilenso continues to exist to this day and is still employee-owned.
From 2019 to 2022, I volunteered as a developer and project manager for Pariyatti, a 501(c)(3) non-profit.
For Pariyatti, I built and maintained their open source backend and mobile apps written in Ruby on Rails and Flutter.

From 2020 to 2024, I worked on two very similar projects.
First, I managed product development for XTDB, an immutable database.
I defined the brand and helped the development team refine the product's UX.
(As a database product, these were two sides of the same coin.)
The architect of XTDB and I left in 2023 to create our own startup: Endatabas.
Endatabas is an open source, immutable SQL document database with disaggregated storage/compute and adaptive indexes.
While working on Endatabas, I decided priorities, guided architecture, wrote all our product's user-facing documentation,
and pitched our product to venture capital firms.

In recent years, I have been interested in emerging technology trends with less pop culture appeal than blockchain or
deep learning.
Local-first software holds a lot of promise in a world which has given up its privacy and right-to-repair to Big Tech.
Third-Wave Open Source provides commercial stability for trustworthy software in the Commons.
Right-to-repair hardware businesses are making the first inroads against traditional vendors.
Governments the world over are realizing that tax dollars shouldn't be spent on products which force vendor lock-in.
I want to work in one of these emerging spaces to create positive change in society.
